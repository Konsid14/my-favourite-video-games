The gameplay is set to the beat of electronic dance music, with the player's actions and movements synchronized to the rhythm of the soundtrack.The objective of the game is to guide the player's character through the level, jumping, flying, and maneuvering in time with the music, while avoiding various obstacles such as spikes, saw blades, and other hazards. As the player progresses through the levels, the difficulty increases, with faster-paced music and more complex level designs.Geometry Dash Lite features a simplified control scheme, with the player only needing to tap or hold the screen to perform actions. This makes the game accessible for a wide range of players, from casual gamers to skilled rhythm game enthusiasts.</p>
