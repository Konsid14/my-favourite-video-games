<p>Stumble Guys is a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) that takes the concept of the popular game Fall Guys and adapts it for mobile devices. The game features colorful, cartoonish characters competing in a series of wacky and challenging obstacle courses in a battle royale-style format.</p>
<p>Gameplay:

Stumble Guys supports up to 60 players in a single match.
Players control a character that must navigate through various obstacle courses, such as spinning platforms, seesaws, and moving platforms.
The objective is to be the last player standing by avoiding elimination. Players are eliminated if they fall off the course or get knocked out by obstacles.
Each round features a different obstacle course, introducing new challenges and requiring players to adapt their strategies.
Between rounds, players can customize their character's appearance by unlocking and equipping different costumes, accessories, and emotes.</p>
